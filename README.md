# Colour-Memory
Just a little colour memory game to keep learning and practice AngularJS.
This is a very rough first alpha/beta build; I am pretty sure there's some stuff that could be better but I will just change it as I see fit.

##  To-Do
* I don't quite like how Animate.CSS animations are performing; they seem slow at times on this setup. Make them smoother.
* When resetting the game the Reset button and Score Bar do not transition smoothly.
* Not cross-browser compatible; gradients should look terrible in Firefox.
* Make it responsive
